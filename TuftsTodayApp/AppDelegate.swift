 It can be a bit confusing to look at, but that's a single week. It's organized in two (or more) columns per day because you can have different blocks going at the same time.

 So for example, you might take Calc 1 Block D+ on Monday/Wednesday, French Block B Tuesday/Thursday/Friday, Physics block N+ Tuesday/Thursday, with a Lab section Monday during block 10, and History block H+ on Tuesday/Thursday.

 The numbered blocks are generally labs or recitations, while the lettered blocks are your base classes
